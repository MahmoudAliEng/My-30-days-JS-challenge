# Controlling CSS varabials from JS

In this project, I showcased a small presentation how we can manage CSS varabiale from our javascript code.

I used just 3 variables : **background**, **padding** and **blur**.

I used data attributes to get the units used in sizing for padding, and string litterals (camed with *ES6*) really help to affect the new values.

Below is a short demo, hope you like it 👍.

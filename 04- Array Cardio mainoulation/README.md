# Array Cardio mainoulation

In this project, we used just the console to write array, string, object manipulation using amazing javascript methods and iterators like ```.sort()```, ```.filter()```, ```.reduce()```, ```.splice()```, ```.join()```, ```.forEach()```  and some *ES6* concepts like the amazing **arrow functions** and **spread operator**.

Hope you enjoy it too.
